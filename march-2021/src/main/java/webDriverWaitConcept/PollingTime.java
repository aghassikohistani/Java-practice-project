		 * What is Polling Time, or interval time in WebDriver Wait?? 
		 * 
		 * Polling and interval time are exactly the same thing 
		 * Polling time is the break time between the WebElements so it will check the WebElement if available it will click on it if not it will poll 
		 * between the WebElements let me show you the constructor WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10, 500);
		 * the 500 is describing the half second which will be doubled in the next iteration until it reaches 10 seconds 
		 * the default polling time is 500 milliseconds 
		 * 
		 * we can use it for list of WebElements as well 
		 *
